I aspire to encourage others through my artwork, spreading positivity, spirit, love, and joy. My paintings are primarily inspired by human life, the processes of life, culture, and nature, with the intention of motivating people. Painting has always been my main passion.",
    "text1": "I create in various styles, including abstract, abstract realism, semi-portrait forms, and illustrations. I understand that there are many different styles of painting, but I enjoy this diversity. I find that limiting myself to a single style can be a bit monotonous. And here I'am excited to share my ideas through my art.",
